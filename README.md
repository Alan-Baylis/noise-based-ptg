* Worley Noise

### Noise functions being worked on currently:

* Diamond-Square Algorithm

### Noise functions to be implemented in the future:

* Value Noise(?)
* Simplex Noise(?)

## Latest Changes

* Perlin class has been reworked and trimmed down. Unneccessary overloading has been removed.
* Perlin class seedless noise generation now works with user-defined offset values.
